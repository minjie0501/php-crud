## What is CRUD?

- When we are building web applications, we want our models to provide four basic types of functionality. Most models will have to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This is often abbreviated as CRUD.

- While is an old style of approaching applications, with new ways of thinking (Domain Driven Design, Event Driven Design) that are more flow based - CRUD is still a large portion of all the programs developed today.
